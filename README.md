# MonoTextDisplay

Like graphics, but don't like GPUs a shaders? Have a nostalgia for the ASCII art of old?

MonoTextDisplay is a way to turn your terminal window into a display using nothing but ASCII characters.

## TextCanvas

The canvas is where the ACSII art images go. Each canvas has a set of layers that are flattened when displayed.

## TextTile

Tiles are reusable pieces of ASCII art like sprites.
